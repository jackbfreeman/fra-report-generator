Other injuries are always immediately apparent, such as bony fractures. Some injuries are considered \"distracting\" from others because the pain they generate distracts attention from other, less painful injuries. There are still other injuries that can \"mask\" pain from nearby parts of the body through complicated pain accommodation mechanisms that are mediated at the spinal cord and in the brain.
