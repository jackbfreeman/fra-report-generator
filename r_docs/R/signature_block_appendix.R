A finding of plausibility is unrelated to the frequency of the injury, because even if the injury occurs in only 1 in 100 or fewer cases of exposure to the event (e.g. a spinal disk injury following a car crash), it is still plausibly caused by the event. Plausibility is a relatively low hurdle to clear in a causal analysis and is largely satisfied by the lack of evidence of implausibility of the relationship. Although it is common in crash injury litigation for the defendant to assert minimal vehicle damage as a basis for disputing injury causation, the approach is unhelpful for evaluating plausibility, as such an analysis does not have a sufficiently low error rate to establish impossibility, and at best can only be used to suggest a low frequency of injury in the general population. An example of an impossible causal relationship is the discovery of leukemia the day after a crash, as it is well established that it is not biologically plausible for trauma to cause leukemia.

First, it must be established that the sequence of the injury and the event is appropriate; the symptoms cannot be identically present prior to the event. Further, the onset of the symptoms of injury cannot be implausibly latent, relative to the injury event. For example, while the symptoms of a spinal disk injury in the neck may not immediately include upper extremity radiculopathy (most such injuries are initially diagnosed as a simple sprain or strain), a complete absence of symptoms in the neck for 3 months after a traffic crash, followed by the sudden insidious onset of symptoms of a cervical disk injury with radiculopathy, could not be plausibly related to the crash in most cases."), style = "NumberList"),

First, evidence of competing injury events must be evaluated, and compared for injury risk. Then, the likelihood of the condition occurring spontaneously must be assessed. For example, the plaintiff may have evidence of degenerative changes in the spinal disks pre-existing a traffic crash, but no symptoms. The question of interest (after the first 2 steps are satisfied) is what the probability was that the condition would have \"converted\" from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the absence of (\"but-for\") the crash. Since there is no information that can be gleaned from an examination of the plaintiff regarding her or her condition in the hypothetical absence of the crash, epidemiologic data often serves as the basis for the evaluation of the probability of alternative explanations. More probable alternative explanations are often intervening traumatic events that alter the clinical history in a substantive way. As an example, for a plaintiff with neck strain symptoms that lasted for 1 week after a crash, who is then involved in second collision a month later that results in neck and arm pain and is ultimately diagnosed with a cervical disk herniation, the second collision is easily identified as a more probable cause of the disk derangement than the antecedent crash. This is in part due to the abrupt change in the distribution of the symptoms more consistent with a disk derangement, but also the epidemiologically based conclusion that it is rare for a cervical strain that improves rapidly to evolve into a cervical disk herniation, and thus but-for the second crash, the condition would not have manifested."), style = "NumberList"),
